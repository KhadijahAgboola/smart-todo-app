# Task Manager Architecture

## Overview
The Task Manager is a simple command-line application that allows users to:
- Add, update, delete, and list tasks  
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete  
- Persist data using a JSON file for storage  

The goal is to provide an easy-to-use task management system that saves data between sessions.
